UriTemplate
===========

UriTemplate is yet another Javascript library for expanding URI templates according to [RFC-6570](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570).
Note it doesn't do everything specified in the RFC and deals with expansion only of URI templates.

# Installation

```shell
npm install https://github.com/robhicks/UriTemplate.git

# or

yarn add https://github.com/robhicks/UriTemplate.git

```

# Use

You can use the library in the browser or on NodeJs.

In the browser you can load dist/UritTemplate.iife.js in
a script tag, or if you are using an es6 aware bundler like RollupJs, you can import it into your
entry file using Node's resolution algorithm (rollup-plugin-node-resolve).

In NodeJs, require it as usual.
